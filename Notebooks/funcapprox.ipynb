    "* Confronted with a non-analytic function $f$ (i.e. something not like $log(x)$), we need a way to numerically represent $f$ in a computer.\n",
    "\t* If your problem is to compute a value function in a dynamic problem, you don't have an analytic representation of $V$.\n",
    "\t* If you need to compute an equilibrium distribution for your model, you probably can't tell it's from one parametric family or another.\n",
    "* Approximations use *data* of some kind which informs us about $f$. Most commonly, we know the function values $f(x_i)$ at a corresponding finite set of points $X = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^N$.\n",
    "* The task of approximation is to take that data and tell us what the function value is at $f(y),y\\not \\in X$.\n",
    "* To an economist this should sound very familiar: take a dataset, learn it's structure, and make predictions.\n",
    "* The only difference is that we can do much better here, because we have more degree's of freedom (we can choose our $X$ in $Y=\\beta X + \\epsilon$)"
